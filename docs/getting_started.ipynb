    "Kooplearn is a machine learning library designed for a specific purpose: implement state-of-the-art algorithmes to learn Koopman/Transfer operators of dynamical systems from data. For a user-friendly introduction to the operatorial perspective on dynamical systems check out [this blog post [TODO]](). \n",

In particular, the transfer operator has rank $N + 1$, it is _non-normal_, and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be computed with arbitrary precision. In `kooplearn` we provide an implementation of the noisy logistic map in {class}`kooplearn.datasets.LogisticMap`.\n",

If the chosen dictionary of functions $(\\phi_{i})_{i = 1}^{d}$ is rich enough, we will have a decent approximation of the transfer operator. We refer to {footcite:t}`Kostic2022` for a mathematically rigorous exposition of these topics. \n",
